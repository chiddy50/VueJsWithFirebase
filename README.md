## Practices
#### General guidelines
- Always keep tests and code simple. Use idiomatic solutions (eg. Vuex test helpers, map functions, etc.) where you can.
- Less code means that you have to read and understand less. Of course, it's only true if you keep your code readable! Do not satisfy readable code in favor of "so-called" elegant, short but hard to understand one.

### 1. Use Vuex
As it's very easy to integrate and it provides a clear and simple architecture to your application, Vuex should be used for simple projects as well without thinking too much.

### 2. Use Vue-Router
